1. cytolytic score
The cytolytic score is a measure of local immune cytolytic activity calculated by the geometric mean of gene expression of granzyme A (GZMA) and perforin (PRF1).
Molecular and genetic properties of tumors associated with local immune cytolytic activity. Cell. 2015;160:48-61.

2. T-cell exhaustion level
To estimate T-cell exhaustion level, the murine T-cell exhaustion signature was obtained. The level of T-cell exhaustion was determined by the mean expression of the up-regulated genes subtracted by the mean expression of down-regulated.

3. risk score
risk score= ∑_(i=1)^n▒〖[coef(mRNAi)*Expression(mRNAi)]〗

4. Definition of cytotoxicity, exhaustion and anergy scores
To assess the transcriptional characteristics of various T cell subsets, we evaluated their exhaustion score, cytotoxicity score, and anergy score, which were established based on a predefined set of genes obtained from a published pan-cancer T cell study.31 Each score was calculated as the average expression level of the respective gene set.
