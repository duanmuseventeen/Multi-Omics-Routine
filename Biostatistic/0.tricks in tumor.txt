1. cytolytic score
The cytolytic score is a measure of local immune cytolytic activity calculated by the geometric mean of gene expression of granzyme A (GZMA) and perforin (PRF1).

2. T-cell exhaustion level
To estimate T-cell exhaustion level, the murine T-cell exhaustion signature was obtained. The level of T-cell exhaustion was determined by the mean expression of the up-regulated genes subtracted by the mean expression of down-regulated.

3. risk score
risk score= ∑_(i=1)^n▒〖[coef(mRNAi)*Expression(mRNAi)]〗

4. Definition of cytotoxicity, exhaustion and anergy scores
To assess the transcriptional characteristics of various T cell subsets, we evaluated their exhaustion score, cytotoxicity score, and anergy score, which were established based on a predefined set of genes obtained from a published pan-cancer T cell study.31 Each score was calculated as the average expression level of the respective gene set.

5. Tumor immune infiltration
Immune cell deconvolution was performed on TPM-normalized counts by CIBERSORT (absolute) using the immunedeconv framework. Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) signatures were computed using the tool, tidepy on TPM normalized gene counts. Immune cell states were deconvolved using EcoTyper using default settings on TPM normalized counts.

6. Degree of hypoxia
We hypothesized that hypoxic tumors may harbor more anaerobic bacteria as these bacteria are well adapted for low-oxygen environments. To test this, we measured the degree of hypoxia using the hallmark hypoxia gene signature in a set of metastatic tumors with matched RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data.

7. Modeling batch effects
Next, we sought to account for false associations derived from technical confounders. To do this we made use of linear mixed effects models (LME) by which we account for sequencer type and hospital location as random effects.

8. Synergy scores
Synergy scores were calculated using SynergyFinder (https://synergyfinder.org/).

9. Define M1/M2 and proliferation phenotypes
The M1/M2 phenotype of each myeloid cell was defined as the mean expression of gene signatures (Azizi et al., 2018). Genes associated 
with ‘‘classically activated’’ (M1) macrophages include CCL5, CCR7, CD40, CD86, CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11, IDO1, IL1A,
IL1B, IL6, IRF1, IRF5 and KYNU, while CCL4, CCL13, CCL18, CCL20, CCL22, CD276, CLEC7A, CTSA, CTSB, CTSC, CTSD,
FN1, IL4R, IRF4, LYVE1, MMP9, MMP14, MMP19, MSR1, TGFB1, TGFB2, TGFB3, TNFSF8, TNFSF12, VEGFA, VEGFB and VEGFC
were used to define the signature of ‘‘alternatively activated’’ (M2) macrophages.
The average expression of known proliferation-related genes was defined as the proliferation score (Whitfield et al., 2006). These
proliferation genes include AURKA, BUB1, CCNB1, CCND1, CCNE1, DEK, E2F1, FEN1, FOXM1, H2AFZ, HMGB2, MCM2, MCM3,
MCM4, MCM5, MCM6, MKI67, MYBL2, PCNA, PLK1, TOP2A, TYMS and ZWINT.

10. Progenitor exhaustion and terminal exhaustion signatures
Progenitor exhaustion and terminal exhaustion signatures used in Figures 2D and 2F were derived from a previous melanoma
study28 (Table S4), and genes related to a T cell mediated immune response to tumor cells in Figure 2B were obtained from
MSigDB (version 7.5.1, https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/index.jsp).
