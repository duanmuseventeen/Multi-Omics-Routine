1. cytolytic score
The cytolytic score is a measure of local immune cytolytic activity calculated by the geometric mean of gene expression of granzyme A (GZMA) and perforin (PRF1).

2. T-cell exhaustion level
To estimate T-cell exhaustion level, the murine T-cell exhaustion signature was obtained. The level of T-cell exhaustion was determined by the mean expression of the up-regulated genes subtracted by the mean expression of down-regulated.
