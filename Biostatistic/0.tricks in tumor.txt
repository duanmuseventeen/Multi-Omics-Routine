1. cytolytic score
The cytolytic score is a measure of local immune cytolytic activity calculated by the geometric mean of gene expression of granzyme A (GZMA) and perforin (PRF1).

2. T-cell exhaustion level
To estimate T-cell exhaustion level, the murine T-cell exhaustion signature was obtained. The level of T-cell exhaustion was determined by the mean expression of the up-regulated genes subtracted by the mean expression of down-regulated.

4. Definition of cytotoxicity, exhaustion and anergy scores
To assess the transcriptional characteristics of various T cell subsets, we evaluated their exhaustion score, cytotoxicity score, and anergy score, which were established based on a predefined set of genes obtained from a published pan-cancer T cell study.31 Each score was calculated as the average expression level of the respective gene set.

5. Tumor immune infiltration
Immune cell deconvolution was performed on TPM-normalized counts by CIBERSORT (absolute) using the immunedeconv framework. Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) signatures were computed using the tool, tidepy on TPM normalized gene counts. Immune cell states were deconvolved using EcoTyper using default settings on TPM normalized counts.

6. Degree of hypoxia
We hypothesized that hypoxic tumors may harbor more anaerobic bacteria as these bacteria are well adapted for low-oxygen environments. To test this, we measured the degree of hypoxia using the hallmark hypoxia gene signature in a set of metastatic tumors with matched RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data.

7. Modeling batch effects
Next, we sought to account for false associations derived from technical confounders. To do this we made use of linear mixed effects models (LME) by which we account for sequencer type and hospital location as random effects.

9. Define M1/M2 and proliferation phenotypes
The M1/M2 phenotype of each myeloid cell was defined as the mean expression of gene signatures (Azizi et al., 2018). Genes associated 
with ‘‘classically activated’’ (M1) macrophages include CCL5, CCR7, CD40, CD86, CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11, IDO1, IL1A,
IL1B, IL6, IRF1, IRF5 and KYNU, while CCL4, CCL13, CCL18, CCL20, CCL22, CD276, CLEC7A, CTSA, CTSB, CTSC, CTSD,
FN1, IL4R, IRF4, LYVE1, MMP9, MMP14, MMP19, MSR1, TGFB1, TGFB2, TGFB3, TNFSF8, TNFSF12, VEGFA, VEGFB and VEGFC
were used to define the signature of ‘‘alternatively activated’’ (M2) macrophages.
The average expression of known proliferation-related genes was defined as the proliferation score (Whitfield et al., 2006). These
proliferation genes include AURKA, BUB1, CCNB1, CCND1, CCNE1, DEK, E2F1, FEN1, FOXM1, H2AFZ, HMGB2, MCM2, MCM3,
MCM4, MCM5, MCM6, MKI67, MYBL2, PCNA, PLK1, TOP2A, TYMS and ZWINT.

10. Progenitor exhaustion and terminal exhaustion signatures
Progenitor exhaustion and terminal exhaustion signatures used in Figures 2D and 2F were derived from a previous melanoma
study28 (Table S4), and genes related to a T cell mediated immune response to tumor cells in Figure 2B were obtained from
MSigDB (version 7.5.1, https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/index.jsp).

11. The immune stimulatory and inhibitory scores
The immune stimulatory and inhibitory scores were calculated with markers collected from Tumor Immune System Interaction Database
and published studies (Supplementary Table 14).

13. Peptide Scoring
The peptide scoring heuristic evaluates four key properties, weighted by their overall importance. In order of decreasing weight, these
are: HLAthena binding rank, NetMHC binding rank, gene TPM, and gene cancer cell fraction. Each property is assigned to a predefined
category—very strong, strong, good, weak, bad, or failing—based on property-specific thresholds. These categories are mapped
to numerical values ranging from 1 (very strong) to 0 (failing). Each numerical value is then multiplied by the corresponding property
weight, and the weighted values are summed to compute the final peptide score.

14. Neoantigen prediction
To predict neoantigens, the detected coding mutations were converted into peptide sequences, and the translated neoantigens (i.e.
peptides with missense mutations and insertions/deletions) were sliced into 8, 9, 10, 11 amino acid lengths for HLA class I binding
prediction. Antigen prediction was performed using HLAthena17 and NetMHCpan version 4.0 (patients P101 – 108) and NetMHC pan
4.1 (patients P109 – 111)58 (eluted ligand rank). NetMHC prediction scores were ranked using HLAthena’s ranking models. Each potential
antigen was ranked as follows: (1) predicted strong binder (rank<0.5) by both prediction models; (2) predicted strong binder by
HLAthena only; (3) predicted strong binder by NetMHCpan only; (4) predicted weak binder (rank<2) by both prediction models; (5)
predicted weak binder by HLAthena only; (6) predicted weak binder by NetMHCpan only, (7) not a predicted binder.

15. Site score. [neoantigens of PTM]
The score was designed to determine whether a PTM tends to fall within the peptide anchor positions or the center positions of the peptide. We
manually determined anchoring or middle positions per haplotype based on the canonical binding motif (Supplementary Information). The percentage of modified
residues or background unmodified residues was summed up for the anchor and middle position in each haplotype. Then, a site score odds ratio was calculated
as follows:
Anchormod/Middlemod
Anchorbckgrnd/Middlebckgrnd 
An enrichment in the anchor positions will result in a high positive score, while an enrichment in the center of the peptide will result in a negative score.
Each haplotype–PTM pair was also given a significance value, based on a χ2 test comparing the percentage distribution between the anchor and the middle, in the
modified and background residues. Benjamini–Hochberg correction was used to control for multiple hypothesis testing.

16. mitochondria-related genes
Given the central role of mitochondria in cell energy production and biological synthesis, which are especially vital for the fate and
function of T cells in tumors, we focused our screening efforts on mitochondrial metabolic genes [16, 35].Using data from MitoCarta [36], 
MitoProteome [37], and AmiGO [38], we identified a total of 1264 mitochondria-related genes (Supplementary Fig. S1B).

17. Enrichment score and exhaustion score (at the level of gene)
For each gene, we defined its enrichment score according to the descending ranking of its log2FC values. For genes significantly 
upregulated in exhausted CD8+ T cells, we further performed Pearson’s correlation analysis between gene expression levels and the 
signature scores of T-cell exhaustion in CD8+ T cells [10], which were defined on the basis of the average expression
levels of PDCD1, CTLA4, HAVCR2, LAG3, and TOX. P values were adjusted via the Benjamini‒Hochberg approach. We defined the exhaustion
score of each gene according to the descending ranking of correlation coefficients.
