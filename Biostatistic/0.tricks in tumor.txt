1. cytolytic score
The cytolytic score is a measure of local immune cytolytic activity calculated by the geometric mean of gene expression of granzyme A (GZMA) and perforin (PRF1).

2. T-cell exhaustion level
To estimate T-cell exhaustion level, the murine T-cell exhaustion signature was obtained. The level of T-cell exhaustion was determined by the mean expression of the up-regulated genes subtracted by the mean expression of down-regulated.

3. risk score
risk score= ∑_(i=1)^n▒〖[coef(mRNAi)*Expression(mRNAi)]〗

4. Definition of cytotoxicity, exhaustion and anergy scores
To assess the transcriptional characteristics of various T cell subsets, we evaluated their exhaustion score, cytotoxicity score, and anergy score, which were established based on a predefined set of genes obtained from a published pan-cancer T cell study.31 Each score was calculated as the average expression level of the respective gene set.

5. Tumor immune infiltration
Immune cell deconvolution was performed on TPM-normalized counts by CIBERSORT (absolute) using the immunedeconv framework. Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) signatures were computed using the tool, tidepy on TPM normalized gene counts. Immune cell states were deconvolved using EcoTyper using default settings on TPM normalized counts.
