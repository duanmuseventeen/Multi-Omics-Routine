As you can see, we can manipulate the trajectory quite a bit by selecting different number of neighbors, components etc. to fit with our assumptions on the development of these celltypes.

Please explore further how you can tweak the trajectory. For instance, can you create a PAGA trajectory using the orignial umap from Seurat instead? Hint, you first need to compute the neighbors on the umap.
