# A total of 8 subsets (C0C8) were identified for epithelial cells, with each subset having unique marker genes (Figure 3ac).

# In accordance with previously reported PCa epithelial
# subtypes18, malignant epithelia exhibited a luminal subtype feature,
# other epithelia showed a basal feature, and normal cells showed
# elevated expression of PTPRC, which is a pan-white cell marker, suggesting
# a mixed subgroup with immune cell contamination (Fig. 1h),
# which were excluded from further study. Such mixed subgroup might
# arise from the process of batch effect removal or the existence of cells
# co-expressing different cell type markers17,19.

# A total of 3 epithelial cell subclusters were classified, most of which
# originated from tumor samples and metastatic lymph nodes
# (Fig. 2a, b). The majority of epithelial cells obtained from adjacent
# tissues were ME1 subcluster, implying the relatively low malignant
# potential of ME1 subcluster. ME2 (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, MET vs AN, p = 0.01; 
# ESCC vs AN, p < 0.001; MET vs ESCC, p = 0.37) and ME3 (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, 
# MET vs AN, p = 0.04; ESCC vs AN, p = 0.001; MET vs ESCC, p = 0.46) subclusters 
# were predominantly collected from tumor samples and metastatic lymph nodes,
# indicating that ME2 and ME3 subclusters may have a high metastatic potential (Fig. 2b).

# To understand the synergistic anti-tumor effects induced by the
# deletion of ERO1A in tumors, we compared the transcriptomes
# of identified tumor clusters from Ero1aWT and Ero1aKO tumors
# based on scRNA-seq analyses (Figure 3A).
